# Clever Code Cravers

The Clever Code Cravers is an open source organization on github.
We store our code here. :smile:

We develop tools that improve our ability to deliver good software fast.

## Our Tools

- **[LocalAppNetChat](https://github.com/CleverCodeCravers/LocalAppNetChat)** <br> A server, a client and a bot helping you to create a dynamic network out of a bunch of scripts and hosts.
- **[LittleScriptBuddy](https://github.com/CleverCodeCravers/LittleScriptBuddy)** <br>Watches files in a folder for a specific c# comment, translating it into a powershell script execution and replacing your comment with it. You could call it cross IDE dynamic snippets.
- **[WindowsServicify](https://github.com/CleverCodeCravers/WindowsServicify)** <br>Takes a command line application and turns it into a windows service. The service will keep your command running no matter what.
